# Seurat Module

This module allows the analysis of scRNA-seq data from a count matrix using the R package Seurat

All analyses implemented are in the "/modules" sub-directory on the shape of nextflow process.

## Workflows

Some small pipelines including multiple processes are pre-made in the "/workflows" directory.

It is possible to include processes and/or workflows in other nextflow scripts, taking into account the input format.
